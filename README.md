- **AI-Enhanced Question Generation:**  
  Advanced algorithms generate contextually relevant questions that are both challenging and informative, helping to solidify knowledge.

## Inspiration

ViBe draws inspiration from the classical Indian tale of Vikram and Betaal. In the story, Betaal challenges King Vikramaditya with riddles, and any incorrect answer prompts a review of the challenge. Similarly, ViBe reinforces learning by requiring students to revisit content if their responses do not meet the mark, ensuring a deep and lasting understanding of the material.
