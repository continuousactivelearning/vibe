## Commit Convention

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for all commits in this project. This ensures that our commit messages are clear and consistent.

The commit message format is:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- **`<type>`**: Indicates the kind of change (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `doc`, etc.).
- **`<scope>`** (optional): Specifies the area of the codebase affected (e.g., `auth`, `courses`, `item`).
- **`<subject>`**: A brief, imperative description of the change.

For more details, please refer to the [Conventional Commits documentation](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
