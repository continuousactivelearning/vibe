## **ViBe**  
### Reimagining Learning, One Question at a Time  
**Inspired by Vikram & Betaal: The Eternal Dialogue**

In the timeless tale of *Vikram and Betaal*, learning wasnâ€™t about passive listening â€” it was about questions that challenged the mind and demanded reflection. Each story ended not with answers, but with a choice to think.

**ViBe carries forward that spirit.**  
Instead of lectures to be watched and notes to be memorized, ViBe encourages active engagement, constant reflection, and ethical learning â€” supported by respectful proctoring and open-source innovation.

### ðŸ”„ Just like Vikramâ€¦
Learners walk the path with patience and purpose, returning each time with deeper understanding.

### ðŸ§  Just like Betaalâ€¦
The system prompts, challenges, and guides â€” not with judgment, but with wisdom designed to spark thought.

**ViBe is our modern retelling.**  
With AI-supported checkpoints, interactive nudges, and a focus on fairness, weâ€™re reimagining education as a conversation â€” not a one-way stream.
