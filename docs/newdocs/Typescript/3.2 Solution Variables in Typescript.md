## 1. Interactive Challenge / Mini-Project

**Your Turn!**

-   Declare a variable called  `city`  and assign it your favorite city as a string.
    
-   Declare a variable called  `temperature`  with type  `number`  and assign it a value.
    
-   Create a variable called  `isRaining`  and let TypeScript infer its type from the value you assign.
    
-   Write a function called  `weatherReport`  that takes  `city`,  `temperature`, and  `isRaining`  as parameters and prints a message like:  
    `"In <city>, it is <temperature>°C. Is it raining? <true/false>"`
    
-   Try calling the function with your variables.
    

## 2. Solution & Deep Dive Explanation

```typescript

let city: string = "Paris";
let temperature: number = 22;
let isRaining = false; // TypeScript infers boolean

function weatherReport(city: string, temperature: number, isRaining: boolean): void {
  console.log(
    `In ${city}, it is ${temperature}°C. Is it raining? ${isRaining}`
  );
}

weatherReport(city, temperature, isRaining);
// Output: In Paris, it is 22°C. Is it raining? false
```

**Explanation:**

-   `city`  is explicitly typed as a string.
    
-   `temperature`  is a number with an explicit type.
    
-   `isRaining`  is assigned a boolean value; TypeScript infers its type automatically.
    
-   The function  `weatherReport`  uses all three variables and prints a formatted message.
    
-   When you call the function with your variables, it outputs a clear weather report.
