## 1. Interactive Challenge / Mini-Project

**Your Turn!**

-   Create a function  `recordAnswer`  that takes a question ID and an answer of any type, and stores it in an object.
    
-   Add at least three answers: a string, a number, and an array.
    
-   Print all recorded answers.
    

## 2. Solution & Deep Dive Explanation

```typescript
let surveyResults: { [questionId: string]: any } = {};

function recordAnswer(questionId: string, answer: any): void {
  surveyResults[questionId] = answer;
}

recordAnswer("q1", "Blue");
recordAnswer("q2", 42);
recordAnswer("q3", ["Option 1", "Option 2"]);

console.log(surveyResults);
```

-   Each answer can be any type.
    
-   Later, you can refactor to use more specific types for each question.
