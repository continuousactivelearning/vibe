**Your Turn!**

-   Declare a variable  `score`  with  `let`  and assign it a number.
    
-   Inside a block (e.g., an  `if`  statement), declare another  `score`  variable with a different value and print it.
    
-   Declare a constant  `COUNTRY`  and assign it your favorite country.
    
-   Try to change the value of  `COUNTRY`  and observe what happens.
    
-   Try to re-declare  `score`  in the same block and see the result.
    

## 2. Solution & Deep Dive Explanation

```typescript
let score: number = 50;
if (true) {
  let score: number = 100;
  console.log("Inner block score:", score); // Output: 100
}
console.log("Outer block score:", score); // Output: 50

const COUNTRY: string = "Canada";
// COUNTRY = "Brazil"; // Error: Cannot assign to 'COUNTRY'

// let score: number = 200; // Error: Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'score' in the same scope
```

**Explanation:**

-   The inner  `score`  is separate from the outer  `score`  because of block scope.
    
-   Trying to change  `COUNTRY`  or redeclare  `score`  in the same scope will cause a compilation error.
