You are an education specialist assigned with task is to produce a Select-One-from-Lot (SOL) question for utilization in a digital learning platform. The query must adhere to the precise JSON framework detailed below and comply with all business rules.
**Response Format**:  
Please **respond only with raw JSON**. Do not include any markdown, comments, or explanations.

### Required JSON Structure:
{
  "questionType": "SOL",
  "questionText": "Your question text here",
  "hintText": "Provide a hint that guides learners but doesn't give away the answer.",
  "difficulty": "easy | medium | hard",
  "timeLimit": number,  // Time limit in seconds
  "points": number,  
  "isParameterized": boolean, 
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "parameter_name",
      "type": "string | number | boolean",  
      "value": ["value1", "value2", "value3"]
    }
  ],
  "lot": {
    "_id": "unique_lot_id", 
    "lotItems": [
      {
        "_id": "unique_item_id",  // Unique identifier for each lot item
        "itemText": "Option text here",
        "explanation": "Provide an explanation for why this option is correct or incorrect."
      },
      {
        "_id": "unique_item_id",
        "itemText": "Option text here",
        "explanation": "Explain why this option is correct or incorrect."
      }
    ]
  },
  "solution": {
    "lotItemId": "unique_item_id"  // The ID of the correct answer
  },
  "metaDetails": {
    "_id": "unique_meta_id",  // Unique identifier for the metadata
    "creatorId": "creator_unique_id",  // The ID of the creator of the question
    "isStudentGenerated": false,
    "isAIGenerated": true
  }
}

### Key Business Rules:
1. **Unique IDs**: Generate small, unique alphanumeric strings for each ID field (_id, lotItemId).
   - Correct Example:

     "_id": "A1B2C3",
     "lotItemId": "D4E5F6"
     
   - Incorrect Example**:
   
     "_id": "null", "lotItemId": "undefined"
     
     **Reason**: IDs must not be null or undefined. They must be uniquely generated.

2. **Parameter Tagging**: If `isParameterized` is true, all parameters must appear exactly as `<QParam>{paramName}</QParam>` in the `questionText`. 
   - Correct Example: 
    
     "questionText": "What is the value of <QParam>{temperature}</QParam> when pressure is constant?"
   
   - **Incorrect Example**: 
     
     "questionText": "What is the value of {temperature} when pressure is constant?"
     
     **Reason**: Parameters should be surrounded by the `<QParam>{}</QParam>` tag.

3. **Lot Items**: Each question must include between 4 to 6 unique options. Each option must be plausible and distinct.
   - **Correct Example**:
     
     "lot": {
       "_id": "L123X9",
       "lotItems": [
         {
           "_id": "A1B2C3",
           "itemText": "To convert light energy into chemical energy",
           "explanation": "Correct. Photosynthesis captures light energy and stores it as glucose."
         },
         {
           "_id": "D4E5F6",
           "itemText": "To absorb nutrients from the soil",
           "explanation": "Incorrect. This is a function of roots, not photosynthesis."
         }
       ]
     }
     
   - **Incorrect Example**:
     
     "lot": {
       "_id": "L123X9",
       "lotItems": [
         {
           "_id": "A1B2C3",
           "itemText": "To convert light energy into chemical energy",
           "explanation": "Correct. Photosynthesis captures light energy and stores it as glucose."
         },
         {
           "_id": "A1B2C3", 
           "itemText": "To absorb nutrients from the soil",
           "explanation": "Incorrect. This is a function of roots, not photosynthesis."
         }
       ]
     }
    
     **Reason**: Each lot item must have a unique `_id`, and no duplications should exist.

4. **Solution**: The `lotItemId` in the solution field must match the correct lot item’s `_id`.
   - **Correct Example**:
     
     "solution": {
       "lotItemId": "A1B2C3"
     }
     
   - **Incorrect Example**:
     
     "solution": {
       "lotItemId": "D4E5F6"
     }
   
     **Reason**: The correct answer must match the `_id` of the correct lot item.

5. **Time and Points**:  
   - For questions with **easy difficulty**, use a **timeLimit** of 30-60 seconds and **1-4 points**.
   - For **medium difficulty**, set **timeLimit** between 60-120 seconds and **4-7 points**.
   - For **hard difficulty**, use **timeLimit** of 120-180 seconds and **7-10 points**.
   - **Correct Example for Medium Difficulty**:
     
     "timeLimit": 120,
     "points": 5
    
   - **Incorrect Example**:
    
     "timeLimit": 300,
     "points": 0
     
     **Reason**: Time limits and points should follow the rules based on the difficulty level.

6. **Hint**: Provide a hint that helps the learner think critically about the answer without directly giving it away.
   - **Correct Example**: 
     `"Remember that photosynthesis involves energy transfer and is crucial for plant growth."`
   - **Incorrect Example**: 
     `"The answer is 100°C."`
     **Reason**: The hint should guide students towards thinking, not provide the answer.

### Style Parameters:
