Generate a single Select-One-from-Lot (SOL) question in JSON format following these exact specifications:

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Return **ONLY raw JSON without any markdown, comments or explanations in the following interface**:

  "timeLimit": number,
  "points": number,
  "isParameterized": boolean,
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": string,
      "type": "string" | "number" | "boolean",
      "value": string[] | number[]
    }
  ],
  "lot": {
    "_id": string,
    "lotItems": [
      {
        "_id": string,
        "itemText": string,

}

BUSINESS RULES:
1. IDs: Generate short unique alphanumeric strings for all _id fields and lotItemId.
  - Correct Example:
      "_id": "A1B2C3",
      "lotItemId": "D4E5F6"

      "_id": "Q1A2B3",
      "lotItemId": "L7M8N9"


  - Incorrect Example:
      "_id": "null",
      "lotItemId": "undefined"

      "_id": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ",
      "lotItemId": "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890"


2. Parameters: If parameterized=true:
   - Each parameter name must appear exactly once in questionText as <QParam>{paramName}</QParam>.
   - Parameter values must be appropriate substitutions.
    - Correct Example:
          "questionText": "What is the value of <QParam>{temperature}</QParam> when pressure is constant?",

          "name": "temperature",
          "type": "number",
          "value": [300, 350, 400]

    - Incorrect Example:
          "questionText": "What is the value of {temperature} when pressure is constant?"

          "name": "temperature",
          "type": "string",
          "value": ["low", "medium", "high"]

3. Lot Items:
   - Include 4–6 options.
   - Each option must be unique and plausible.
   - Include clear explanation why each wrong option might be tempting.
    - Correct Example:
        "lot": {
            "_id": "L123X9",
            "lotItems": [
              {
                "_id": "A1B2C3",
                "itemText": "To convert light energy into chemical energy",
                "explanation": "Correct. Photosynthesis captures light energy and stores it as glucose."
              },
              {
                "_id": "D4E5F6",
                "itemText": "To absorb nutrients from the soil",
                "explanation": "Tempting but incorrect—this is a function of roots, not photosynthesis."
              },
              {
                "_id": "G7H8I9",
                "itemText": "To decompose organic matter",
                "explanation": "Incorrect—decomposition is carried out by bacteria and fungi, not plants via photosynthesis."
              },
              {
                "_id": "J1K2L3",
                "itemText": "To regulate the plant’s temperature",
                "explanation": "Misleading—transpiration plays a role in temperature regulation, not photosynthesis directly."
              }
            ]
          }

    - Incorrect Example:
      "lot": {
      "_id": "L00000",
      "lotItems": [
        {
          "_id": "sameID",
          "itemText": "To convert sunlight into food",
          "explanation": "Correct answer."
        },
        {
          "_id": "sameID",
          "itemText": "Photosynthesis is for digestion.",
          "explanation": "Wrong answer."
        },
        {
          "_id": "sameID",
          "itemText": "It absorbs sunlight for no reason.",
          "explanation": "Incorrect."
        }
      ]
      }


4. Solution:
   - lotItemId must match _id of the correct lotItem.
    - Correct Example (Reference of correct example from above):
        "solution": {
        "lotItemId": "A1B2C3"
        }
    - Incorrect Example:
        "solution": {
        "lotItemId": "L4M5N6"
        }
    

5. Timing & Points:
   - timeLimit: 30–180 seconds based on complexity.
   - points: 1–10 based on difficulty:
          - Easy: 1-4 points, 30-60 seconds.
          - Medium: 4-7 points, 60-120 seconds.
          - Hard: 7-10 points, 120-180 seconds.
      - Correct Example for Medium Difficulty:
          "timeLimit": 120,
          "points": 5
      - Incorrect Example for Medium Difficulty:
          "timeLimit": 300,
          "points": 0

6. Hint: Provide a pedagogically useful hint that guides thinking without revealing the answer.
    - Correct Example:
       "hintText": "Remember that the boiling point of water varies with pressure and altitude."
    - Incorrect Example:
       "hintText": "The answer is 100°C."
